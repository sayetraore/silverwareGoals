Restaurant Task Timer & Earnings Tracker
A web app designed to track silverware rolling contest times and employee earnings while maintaining complete data privacy.

Disclaimers & Info
This web app was designed by Saye Traore for my co-workers and is no longer in use.

Your earnings and private data are fully encrypted and cannot be seen by me or anyone else.

The private code you use is stored securely and cannot be accessed by anyone, including the admin.

Originally designed for my co-workers, but open for anyone who finds it useful.
